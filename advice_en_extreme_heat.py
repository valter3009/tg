    ('+31 to +40', 'clear', 'winter', 'morning'): "A morning with temperatures above +30 in the middle of winter — when even the thermometer seems to be checking itself for malfunction. Wear a t-shirt and shorts. And seriously consider moving to a bunker, because such weather is obviously a sign that climate apocalypse is already here, just fashionably late like every train in your city.",

And stop making plans for February, because after such winter there'll either be +50 in summer or a new ice age — nature clearly lost its instruction manual.",

    ('+31 to +40', 'clear', 'winter', 'evening'): "An evening with +30 in winter — when sunset looks beautiful, but you understand it's not romance, it's the planet saying goodbye to normal climate. Wear a t-shirt and shorts. And if someone says 'at least no need to shovel snow,' punch them — optimism in the face of climate catastrophe is a sign of either stupidity or very good pills.",

    ('+31 to +40', 'clear', 'winter', 'night'): "A night with +30 in the middle of winter — when you can't sleep not from cold, but from existential horror that your grandchildren will only see snow in museums.

    ('+31 to +40', 'cloudy', 'winter', 'morning'): "A cloudy morning with +35 in winter — when nature itself seems ashamed of what's happening and hides behind clouds. Wear a t-shirt and shorts.

    ('+31 to +40', 'cloudy', 'winter', 'day'): "A day when it's +35 in winter and clouds try to pretend everything's fine. Wear a t-shirt and shorts. And stop believing weather forecasts — they're as helpless before this climate chaos as you are before your mortgage payments.",

    ('+31 to +40', 'cloudy', 'winter', 'evening'): "An evening with abnormally high temperature in winter — when even clouds look confused about what season it is. Wear a t-shirt and shorts. And prepare for tomorrow to either continue this madness or bring -20 — Russian weather in the climate change era is more unpredictable than a drunk ex with your phone number.",

    ('+31 to +40', 'cloudy', 'winter', 'night'): "A night with +30 in winter under cloudy sky — when you realize the apocalypse won't come with trumpets and fire, but with quiet confusion about what to wear. Wear a t-shirt and shorts. And don't try to plan anything long-term — in a world where it's +30 in January, any plans beyond tomorrow are pure fantasy.",

    ('+31 to +40', 'overcast', 'winter', 'morning'): "An overcast morning with hellish heat in winter — when the sky is as gloomy as your thoughts about the future of the planet.

    ('+31 to +40', 'overcast', 'winter', 'evening'): "An overcast evening with abnormal heat in winter — perfect time to contemplate how humanity managed to break the planet's thermostat. Wear a t-shirt and shorts. And don't hope for snow — at this rate, your grandchildren will think snowmen are mythical creatures like unicorns.",

    ('+31 to +40', 'overcast', 'winter', 'night'): "A night with +30 in winter under overcast sky — when even darkness can't hide how wrong everything has gone. Wear a t-shirt and shorts.

    ('+31 to +40', 'rain', 'winter', 'morning'): "A morning with rain and +35 in winter — when nature decided that abnormal temperature alone wasn't enough, let's add humidity too.

    ('+31 to +40', 'rain', 'winter', 'day'): "A rainy day with +35 in the middle of winter — when you realize winter rain is no longer an exception but the new normal. Wear a t-shirt and take an umbrella. And stop hoping for snow — hope, like polar bears, is on the verge of extinction.",

    ('+31 to +40', 'rain', 'winter', 'evening'): "An evening with warm rain in winter — when drops on the window remind you not of romantic mood but of how badly we've screwed up the climate.

    ('+31 to +40', 'thunderstorm', 'winter', 'day'): "A day with thunderstorm and +35 in winter — when lightning in the sky competes with the shocking realization that this is the new normal.

    ('+31 to +40', 'clear', 'spring', 'morning'): "A clear spring morning with temperatures above +30 — when you realize spring lasted exactly three days and summer came two months early.

    ('+31 to +40', 'cloudy', 'spring', 'morning'): "A cloudy spring morning with +35 — when clouds try to protect you from the sun but can't protect you from the heat.

    ('+31 to +40', 'cloudy', 'spring', 'night'): "A cloudy spring night with +30 — when clouds hold the heat like a greenhouse, and you understand the term 'greenhouse effect' literally on your own skin.
